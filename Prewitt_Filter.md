# Prewitt Filter

The **Prewitt filter** is a type of edge detection algorithm used in image processing to identify the edges or boundaries in an image. It is named after Judith M. S. Prewitt, who introduced the operator in the context of image processing. The filter highlights regions of the image where intensity changes abruptly, which typically correspond to edges.

# Mathematical Approach to Applying the Prewitt Filter

## Define the Prewitt Operator
The Prewitt filter is a convolution-based edge detection operator that computes the gradient of the image intensity in both the horizontal and vertical directions. It uses two kernels (filters):

1. **Horizontal**:
   ```
   G_x =
   [-1  0  1]
   [-1  0  1]
   [-1  0  1]
   ```

2. **Vertical**:
   ```
   G_y =
   [-1 -1 -1]
   [ 0  0  0]
   [ 1  1  1]
   ```
These kernels represent the gradient calculation in the horizontal and vertical directions.

## Apply the Convolution
Convolution is the process of applying the filter to each pixel in the image matrix. Since youâ€™re dealing with a 10x10 image matrix, you apply these kernels over the image by sliding them over each 3x3 region of the matrix, starting from the top-left corner and moving pixel by pixel.

For each pixel at position \((i, j)\), the Prewitt filter computes two values: one for the horizontal gradient \(G_x\) and one for the vertical gradient \(G_y\).

To compute the value for \(G_x\) and \(G_y\) at each pixel, you multiply the corresponding values in the kernel with the values in the image matrix and sum the results.

### For \(G_x\) (horizontal gradient):

$$
G_x(i, j) = \sum_{k=-1}^{1} \sum_{l=-1}^{1} I(i+k, j+l) \cdot G_x(k+1, l+1)
$$

Where \(I(i+k, j+l)\) represents the pixel values in the image matrix, and \(G_x(k+1, l+1)\) corresponds to the elements of the kernel.

### Similarly, for \(G_y\) (vertical gradient):

$$
G_y(i, j) = \sum_{k=-1}^{1} \sum_{l=-1}^{1} I(i+k, j+l) \cdot G_y(k+1, l+1)
$$

## Compute the Magnitude of the Gradient
Once the gradients in both directions are calculated for each pixel, the overall gradient magnitude \(G(i,j)\) is calculated by combining the horizontal and vertical gradients using the following formula:

$$
M(i, j) = \sqrt{G_x(i, j)^2 + G_y(i, j)^2}
$$

This gives you the magnitude of the gradient at each pixel, which corresponds to the strength of the edge at that point.

## Thresholding
To identify the edges in the image, you can apply a threshold to the gradient magnitude. If \(G(i,j)\) exceeds a certain threshold value, the pixel is considered part of an edge. Otherwise, it is considered as part of the background. The thresholding step helps in distinguishing strong edges from weaker noise.

$$
\text{Edge}(i, j) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } G(i, j) > T \\
0 & \text{if } G(i, j) \leq T
\end{cases}
$$

Where \(T\) is the chosen threshold value.

## Result
After applying the Prewitt filter and thresholding, you will have a binary matrix representing the detected edges. The edges will be marked with a value of 1 (or 255 in a grayscale image), and the non-edges will be 0.

## Line Detection
After detecting the edges, you can analyze the binary matrix to find the start and end coordinates of the detected line. A simple way to do this would be to iterate through the matrix and find the first and last pixel positions that are part of the edge (value 1). These coordinates correspond to the start and end of the detected line.

### **Edge Direction**
The edge direction can be calculated:

- **Direction**:
  
$$
\theta(i, j) = \arctan\left(\frac{G_y(i, j)}{G_x(i, j)}\right)
$$

## **Applications**
1. **Edge Detection**: Identifying object boundaries in images.
2. **Image Segmentation**: Separating different regions in an image.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Pre-processing step in computer vision tasks.

## **Comparison with Other Filters**
- **Sobel Filter**: Similar to Prewitt but uses weighted convolution kernels that give more emphasis to the center pixels, making it more robust to noise.
- **Canny Edge Detector**: A more sophisticated method that involves gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and thresholding for edge linking.

The Prewitt filter is simpler and computationally less expensive compared to methods like the Canny Edge Detector but may be less effective in detecting fine edges in noisy images.
